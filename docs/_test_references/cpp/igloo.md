# {{ page.title }}

BDD style unit testing framework [Igloo](http://igloo-testing.org/) can be used to test C++ code.

## Basic Setup

{{ page.basic_setup | markdownify }}


## Assertions

An assertion in Igloo is written using the following format:

```cpp
Assert::That(actual_value, <constraint expression>);
```

where `<constraint expression>` is an expression that
`actual_value` is evaluated against when the test is executed.

See [Igloo Assertions](http://igloo-testing.org/assertions.html) for the list of available expressions.
