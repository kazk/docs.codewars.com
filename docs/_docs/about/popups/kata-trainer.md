# Kata Trainer

## Buttons

### Attempt

This button will submit your code against the full set of tests needed to complete the kata.

### Run Examples

This button will submit the tests shown within the example test cases section.
Most kata will have provided you some starter example tests to get you going, while others will not,
in which case some test documentation will be shown instead.

If you care about using TDD development, then the example tests section will be very useful for you.
You are encouraged to write your own tests as you try to complete the kata, as you would if you were writing production code.

## Production Quality Code

Some Codewarriors like to write code golfed or creative/clever solutions, but most try to write production quality code.
After you have completed all of the test cases (via the attempt button),
you will be given an opportunity to cleanup your code so that its "code review" ready.
