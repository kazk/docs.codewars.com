## Kata

Codewars is a community driven site aimed at training Codewarriors into becoming master developers.
The main activity of a Codewarrior is to train and hone your craft through the use of kata.
**Kata are short coding exercises** that are designed to test your abilities.
Through this process of solving kata you will learn a great deal.
Once you complete a kata, you will also be shown the solutions of your fellow Codewarriors,
which can often bring a whole new level of clarity to solving problems that you didn't think were possible.

> An import thing to note. All kata on this site are created by your fellow Codewarriors.
> You will quickly discover how powerful the Codewars community is with this level of community contribution and collaboration.

## Ranks

We use a **"kyū" system** to help indicate which level you have trained to,
as well as to indicate which level a kata (code challenge) belongs to.
Starting at 8 kyū, you will advance all the way to 1 kyū.
This system is borrowed from Japanese martial arts and the game of Go,
where the levels count the number of degrees you are away from being a "Master".

## Honor

Honor is what we call the points that you earn when doing activities on the site.
We won't get too deep into honor right now but an important thing to remember is that honor and ranks are treated differently.
