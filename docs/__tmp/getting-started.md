## Getting Started

The easiest way of getting started is to use our trainer on the dashboard to pick your next kata.

The trainer allows you to pick your language, select your focus, preview the challenge,
skip to another challenge and to start training.

For newer developers, we recommend that you pick the "Fundamentals" focus track,
which will randomly select easier kata for you to train on.

For experienced developers looking for a challenge, you can select the "Rank Up" focus track,
which will cause you to begin with easy to medium challenges and quickly advance to harder ones.

For those really looking for a hard challenge,
we recommend you go directly to the full list of kata where you can select from over 3000 kata to train on.
Remember, 1 kyÅ« is the hardest level.

Go ahead and get started by training on a kata now!
